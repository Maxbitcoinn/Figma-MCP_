# Cursor MCP Figma Plugin Test Prompts

This page contains a comprehensive collection of test prompts for systematically testing all MCP tools available in the Figma plugin integration with Cursor AI.

## IMPORTANT: General rules

- Try the happy path first as described below sections
- If faced with an error, monitor the terminal that is running the websocket server for more information

```

### Set Padding
```
Set padding of the selected frame to top: 20px, right: 16px, bottom: 20px, left: 16px
```

### Set Axis Alignment
```
Set the selected auto-layout frame's primary axis to CENTER and counter axis to CENTER
```

### Set Layout Sizing
```
Set the selected frame's horizontal sizing to FILL and vertical sizing to HUG
```

### Set Item Spacing
```
Set primary axis alignment to SPACE_BETWEEN 
Set the item spacing of the selected auto-layout frame to 15px
Set the counter axis spacing to 15px
```

## üîç Node Scanning & Analysis

### Scan by Node Types
```
Scan the selected frame for all FRAME and COMPONENT type nodes
```

### Comprehensive Node Scan
```
Scan the blue frame for nodes of types: FRAME, COMPONENT, INSTANCE, TEXT
```

## üé≠ Components & Instances

### Get Local Components
```
Get all local components from the current document
```

### Create Component Instance
```
Create an instance of the first component at position x: 400, y: 400
```

### Get Instance Overrides
```
Get override properties from the selected component instance
```

### Set Instance Overrides
```
Apply overrides from the source instance to the selected target instances
```

### Component Instance Workflow

## üìù Usage Instructions

1. **Setup**: Ensure the MCP server is running and connected
2. **Channel**: Always join a channel before testing (use @terminal that is running the websocket server, and use the channel name that is shown in the terminal)
3. **Selection**: Select appropriate nodes in Figma before running node-specific tests
4. **Verification**: Check results in Figma after each operation
5. **Debugging**: Monitor console logs for detailed operation feedback
