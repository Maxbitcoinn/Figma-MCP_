# TTS Script: Text Replacement Strategy Demo with TalkToFigma MCP

## Brief Introduction (0:00-0:20)
Hi, I'm Jude, a product designer.

I'm really excited about Sonny's Talk-to-Figma MCP.
It's an amazing tool that's changing how we work with Figma.

I'm grateful for his work,
and today I'm demonstrating new tools and prompts I've contributed through my recent pull request.

Inspired by plugins like Google Sheet sync,
I wanted to create a different approach to filling designs with real or dummy data using MCP's capabilities.

Let me show you how this works.
I have this sample markdown file with animal data
that we'll use to transform this user management table.

First, let's see what we're working with...
TalkToFigma is scanning the frame to understand its structure.
Cool, now we know where all the text nodes are.

Let's start with the table headers -
changing them to match our animal database columns...
and now for the content.
I'll replace these five rows with our animal data...
See how it keeps all the styling and layout intact?

Oh wait, we forgot something!
The filter section still shows the old user management text.
Let me fix that...
'Search animals', 'Category' for the dropdown,
and update these action buttons.
Much better!

Let's verify everything by exporting an image...
Perfect!
The whole interface is now consistently themed around our animal database.

You know what would be cool in the future?
Being able to modify text properties like Fill and Hug constraints directly through MCP.

Not there yet, haha,
but this current version already opens up some interesting possibilities
for working with structured data in Figma.

This is just the beginning -
I'm excited to see how we can push this further!

## Title
New Approach to Design Content Population with Talk-to-Figma MCP 

## Description
🇬🇧 English
Introducing a new approach to populating design content using Talk-to-Figma MCP. Moving beyond traditional methods like Google Sheets sync, this contribution demonstrates how we can leverage MCP's capabilities to transform design content more flexibly and intelligently.

Demo Features:
• Smart content population that preserves design structure
• Seamless transformation of complex interfaces (tables, filters, etc.)
• Context-aware content updates across multiple elements
• Design system consistency maintained throughout the process

A contribution to Sonny's Talk-to-Figma MCP project, exploring new possibilities in design automation.

토크투피그마 MCP를 활용한 디자인 콘텐츠 채우기의 새로운 접근 방식을 소개합니다. 구글 시트 연동과 같은 기존 방식을 넘어서, MCP의 특성을 활용해 더 유연하고 지능적으로 디자인 콘텐츠를 변환하는 방법을 보여드립니다.

주요 기능:
• 디자인 구조를 보존하는 스마트 콘텐츠 채우기
• 복잡한 인터페이스(테이블, 필터 등)의 자연스러운 변환
• 여러 요소에 걸친 문맥 인식 콘텐츠 업데이트
• 디자인 시스템 일관성 유지

Sonny의 토크투피그마 MCP 프로젝트에 기여하며 디자인 자동화의 새로운 가능성을 탐구합니다.

Hey Design team! 👋

Over the weekend, I got really inspired by @sonny.lazuardi's Talk-to-Figma MCP project and couldn't stop thinking about how we could use it for our data-heavy design workflows. 

🎥 Just uploaded a quick demo: https://youtu.be/j05gGT3xfCs
Shows how we can transform entire table interfaces with MCP - think Google Sheets sync, but with AI superpowers! Tested it with our typical data table scenarios and it works like a charm.

GitHub PR: https://github.com/sonnylazuardi/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/42

@sonny.lazuardi Thanks for the awesome tool! Now... how about that PR merge? 😉 No pressure, just excited to contribute!

🚀 Excited to share my contribution to Talk-to-Figma MCP!

Have you seen the groundbreaking Talk-to-Figma MCP by my brilliant colleague Sonny Lazuardi? It's not just another Figma plugin - it's a glimpse into the future of design tools. Sonny's innovative approach to combining natural language processing with Figma operations has opened up entirely new possibilities for design automation.

Inspired by his vision, I couldn't help but jump in and contribute. I've added new tools and prompts that bring Google Sheets-like sync capabilities to the project, but with a twist - it's powered by AI!

🔍 What I've built on top of Sonny's amazing foundation:
• Smart text scanning system that understands design structure
• Intelligent content population that preserves styling
• Batch text replacement for complex interfaces
• Real-time progress tracking for large-scale operations

퇴근하고 이것저것 만지다가 재밌는거 하나 만들었습니다 ㅎㅎ

우리 팀 @sonnylazuardi가 만든 Talk-to-Figma MCP를 보시면서 '이거 뭔가 더 재밌게 쓸 수 있지 않을까?' 하다가... 구글 시트처럼 데이터 채우기 기능을 한번 넣어봤어요. 근데 이제는 AI랑 같이! 

'이게 될까?' 싶었는데... 됩니다; 생각보다 잘됩니다 ㅎㅎ
AI 에이전트랑 같이 하니까 더 똑똑하게 데이터도 읽고 디자인도 이해하네요.

데모 영상도 찍어봤으니 한번 봐주세요! 🙏

구글 시트처럼 데이터 채우기 기능인데, 이제는 AI 에이전트랑 함께합니다.
텍스트도 알아서 스캔하고, 디자인 구조도 이해하고... 
'이게 될까?' 했는데 생각보다 잘 되더라구요 ㅎㅎ

한번 보실래요?
