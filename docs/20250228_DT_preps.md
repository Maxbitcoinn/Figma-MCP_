[Slide 1 - Introduction]
Hello everyone, I'm Joo, working on Developer Experience at TI design.
It's great to be here in Ho Chi Minh City for our Console workshop. The discussions we've had over the past few days have been incredibly valuable for this project.

Today, I'll be presenting on "Console." Console is a project that provides a unified experience for Grab's tech infrastructure platforms.
In this presentation, I'll cover who our users are, the challenges they face, and our solution - Console. I'll also share user feedback and our roadmap going forward. Let's get started.

[Slide 2 - Who are our users?]
Let's talk about who will be using Console. This isn't just another tool - it's a solution that impacts our entire tech ecosystem at Grab.

Looking at the numbers, we have over 5,600 Grabbers working on products - that's three out of every four people at Grab. And within our company, more than 2,700 colleagues work in the tech division.

But Console's impact goes beyond just direct users. When our tech infrastructure becomes more efficient, it creates ripple effects across the entire organization. Engineers spend less time searching for tools, product teams get faster deployments, and ultimately, our customers experience better products.

So while the primary users are in our tech division, the benefits will be felt by everyone who interacts with our technology - which is essentially everyone at Grab. This is why Console matters - it's about making all of us more effective by removing the friction in our daily work.

[Slide 3 - Discovery]
Let me show you three major challenges our colleagues face today.
First, discovery is difficult. Finding the right tools is a constant challenge for everyone. We have wiki and... Gleaning, but people still rely on asking around or searching through Slack channels.
I know it does not make sense, but the reality is like this.

[Slide 4 - Ecosystem]
Well, there were many reasons behind but one of the major reason is.. our ecosystem is fragmented. We have over 65 UIs across more than 60 platforms. Just think about that number for a moment. That's a lot of different places our colleagues need to visit to get their work done.

[Slide 5 - Communication]
Related to this, communication is also limited. Platform teams struggle to announce changes, and users don't have a clear channel for feedback. It's like having a conversation with a wall between people.

[Slide 6 - Conclusion]
When we surveyed our colleagues, their message was crystal clear: we need one integrated platform experience.

Honestly, it's not our first time trying to solve this problem. Some teams in TI tried different approaches before, but none fully solved our fragmentation problem. 

Because those previous attempts mostly focused on connecting systems together without really thinking about how people would actually use them. They were technical solutions missing the human touch.

That's why TI design team has been involved this project from day one.. We're making sure Console isn't just technically sound, but actually makes sense for the people using it every day.

I'm excited to show you what this looks like in practice. Let me give you a quick tour of Console. 


[Slide 7 - Introduction of Console]

Demo Video Playing:
- Starting from a single entry point at console.grab.com
- Our platform index gives you an immediate overview of all available tools
- You can easily filter and find what you need
- Each platform has its own detailed info page
- And you can open and use platforms directly within Console 
- Best part is, you can also switch between platforms in a single tab~!

[Slide 8 - Key feature - Drill down]
Now let's quickly drill down into the key features we're building. As you saw in the overview, these directly address the challenges we identified.

Our first feature is Platform Discoverability - simply put, all TI platforms organized by category so you can find what you need without asking around in Slack.

[Slide 9 - (Key features continued)]
Next is Unified Platform Navigation - switch between platforms in a single tab using micro-frontend architecture. No more context switching between multiple browser tabs.

Global Search lets you find anything across platforms, documentation, and resources from one search bar - powered by Glean.

[Slide 10 - Feature 4 & Integration Values]
Finally, Platform News & Info Pages give each platform its own space for updates and documentation - bridging the communication gap between platform teams and users.

Beyond what I've shown today, we're working on many features to integrate with over 40 TI platforms. It's a lot of work, but we stay focused by keeping these four values in mind: discoverability, efficiency, consistency, and transparency.

[Slide 11 - User Feedback]
And our approach is working. The early feedback from our colleagues has been incredibly positive.

We've conducted an initial survey  across various tech roles. While this is just early feedback, the results validate everything we believed about the importance of user experience.

Looking at these charts, you can see strong positive responses across all our key features - with platform discoverability and global search receiving particularly high ratings at 83%.

These early numbers give us confidence that we're addressing the right pain points. As we move forward with implementation, we'll continue gathering more comprehensive feedback to refine the experience.

[Slide 12 - What's Coming Next]
Let me share our upcoming plans for Console.

We're launching general access in Q2 2025, starting with support for over 48 platforms. Among these, we're particularly excited about 13 tools that will offer a unified experience - meaning you can use them directly within Console through micro-frontend integration.

And this is just the beginning. We'll keep expanding the number of integrated tools. For example, GrabGPT or SuperSet that you use every day, to make them easily accessible from Console. 

We're excited to have you try it out soon and help us shape this experience together.
